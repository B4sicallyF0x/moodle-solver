# Moodle Solver

## Moved to Ko-Fi -> https://ko-fi.com/s/c0776db2ad

**Description:**

In many Moodle quizzes, you have two or more attempts. After completing an attempt, you have access to a review page where you can view your results.
This set of scripts allows you to get the correct answers to a Moodle test on a failed first attempt and use them on a second attempt to get a good grade.

## How to use it?

1. Answer randomly on the first try to get the correct answers.
2. Use `get_answers.js` on the review page to get the correct answers and save them to local storage.
3. Start a new test attempt.
4. Run `set_answers.js` (or a bookmarklet) to fill in the correct answers and submit the test.



## **⚠️** **Important warning:**

This method is **not** recommended for academic purposes. Using this method to obtain artificially high scores on tests or exams is a form of **cheating** and violates the principles of academic integrity. There is a risk of being detected, which can have **serious academic consequences**. I am not responsible for the uses that are given to this tool.



## **Adaptation for Galician:**

These scripts are adapted to work in Galician. In order for them to work correctly with tests in languages other than Galician, you must translate the corresponding selectors.
